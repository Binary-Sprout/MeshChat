MeshChat is an ESP32 based wifi mesh chat that uses html.
Just conect your device and goto mesh.local in your brower.
This is system could be useful to remain in contact with friends in the same building or even further depending on setup and amount of nodes used.
Nothings stable right now and needs more work but for now people can use it.
If you want your own private mesh then just ass a wifi password.
All nodes must have the same name to mesh together automaticly if in range.
If you want to try make a larger public mesh then leave the wifi settings as they are ands use without changing anything before flashing to youyr esp32.
Thats it for now.

Hope its useful to some extent.
Thx for testing.
