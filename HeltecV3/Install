Setup Guide for Heltec V3 Version
Overview
This version of the project is specifically tailored for the Heltec V3 board, with LoRa and the OLED screen disabled for now but intended for future use. This allows you to repurpose your spare Heltec V3 device for WiFi mesh networking using this code.

Required Libraries
The updated version does not introduce new libraries beyond what was used in the original setup. Ensure the following libraries are installed:

painlessMesh - Provides mesh networking capabilities.
ESPAsyncWebServer - Manages asynchronous web server requests.
DNSServer - Handles DNS redirection required for the captive portal.
These libraries should already be installed from the original project setup. No additional libraries are needed.

Board Selection
To ensure proper functionality on the Heltec V3 board, follow these steps in the Arduino IDE:

Select the Board:
Go to Tools > Board, and select Heltec WiFi LoRa V3.
If Heltec WiFi LoRa V3 is not available, you can alternatively select ESP32 Dev Module as a compatible option.
Notes
The current version disables LoRa and the OLED screen but is designed with future expansion in mind, allowing these features to be re-enabled when needed.
Ensure your ESP32 core is updated to the latest version to support the Heltec V3.
This guide allows you to seamlessly integrate the Heltec V3 into your mesh network with the provided code, maximizing the utility of your spare device.
