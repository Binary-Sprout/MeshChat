Required Libraries:

No Different Libraries Needed: The libraries required for the updated version are the same as those used in the original project:
painlessMesh
ESPAsyncWebServer
DNSServer
Board Selection:
Select the Board:
Choose Heltec WiFi LoRa V3 in the Arduino IDE under Tools > Board.
If Heltec WiFi LoRa V3 is not listed, you can alternatively select ESP32 Dev Module.
Additional Note:
Ensure that the ESP32 core is updated to the latest version using the URL provided earlier.
This is all you need for the updated code to work on the Heltec V3 board without using LoRa or the OLED display.
